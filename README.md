# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Movies to Watch 2.0 by YOUR_NAME

A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of *Movies to Watch*.


# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
For me, this project took 9 days to make all functions work. movie_collection.py and movie.py took just a day with testing
main.py and kivy app took me a week so that I have deep understanding of kivy, how i can link kivy and main.py and
how to call methods and display them on interface. 

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I am satisfied that I can make an app and understand small parts of the codes of python linked to kivy and classes.
Being able to use classes and methods from other python is useful in real life. Being able to write modular codes that
can be called to other functions and use them is efficient and necessary in real work. I am satisfied that I have learned
things that can be used in real work.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
I am not satisfied I had to research a lot more outside presentation slides for kivy. Most of what we have to do for kivy
are from outside lectures. But in the end, it is what we will have to in our jobs. If we don't know about
something, we will have to do a lot research and learn. This will be how we wll have to do our learning in the future.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
moviecollection.py, movie.py and a1classes.py are not too difficult since they are just writing functions and modifying
assignment 1 to use those classes.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
My research time will be improved. I learned a lot about kivy and classes here. I have ideas of what to do now.
I know which parts to research. So, time-taken will be lower. 

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
I used lecture slides mostly. They have most of what I need. I tried to make my code work after learning from those slides.
But for main.py and app.kv, I research online, try to understand how they write, write my code and test them out and 
make mine work. 

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The main challenges when i started main.py, I was lost, not sure whether to start. But I start to break down functions
by functions, consider what is needed in each one and coding. For thing that I didn't know how to, I go to lecture slides,
practicals I have done and if not, my last resort is online. I tried to look as much as possible in school material
because most of what we have to do are in them.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
Classes are modular which can be used anytime if I just call that function. If I have a problem with code or something
is not working, I can just check functions that are not working. I can just check each method and not need to go
through the entire code which is efficient and less time-consuming. They improved my coding skills that I can make 
codes independent and can use whenever I want and even different programs.
